# Predicting Stock shares with AI

- In this study case we are trying to decide which Stock shares from Brazil's stock exchange we should by based on predictions made by our model.

- We merged together data from more than 60 different companies from Brasil and compared it with IBOVESPA.

- The **Bovespa Index**, best known as **Ibovespa** is the benchmark index of about 92 stocks traded on the [B3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B3_(stock_exchange)) (Brasil Bolsa Balc√£o), accounting for the majority of trading and market capitalization in the Brazilian [stock market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market). It is weighted measurement index.

- We determined the final action as Buy or sell, the ones we buy got the result of 2 and the ones we sell got 0
- Since we are trying to focus on the ones we are buying we'll predict the results we should buy it.
